"Honey, what do you want for dinner?"

## Description

Group Project 1 was inspired by a common experience: Trying to decide what to have for dinner. Whether you're extremely indecisive or looking for new suggestions, CAN'T DECIDE: The Dinner Date Picker is here to help!

Our other motivation was to show off what we learned from the previous lessons. In this project we demonstrate a knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API implementation.

We collaborated strongly as a team, utilizing organizational tools like SCRUM meetings and a Kanban board to deliver a finished website.

## Usage

On the landing page of the website, we provided some short blurbs about the website and who we are. An input box asks the user to input their target city. After the user types an answer, an orange button appears. After clicked, a modal appears displaying six input options with prompts for food suggestions. The user will then press the "Go!" button and will be taken to the next page.

On this page the user's food options are populated on a spinning game wheel. The user will click the spin button at the center of the wheel. The wheel will spin and land on a random option. The integrated Yelp API will then populate a list of 8 restaurant recommendations cards under the wheel. The cards have information on the restaurant's address, phone number, price, and average rating. Our weather API will display the current weather in the user's target city under the wheel as well.

It's everything you need to plan a night out!
